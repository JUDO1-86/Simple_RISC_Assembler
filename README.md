# Simple_RISC_Assembler
This project is a web-based assembler for the SimpleRISC instruction set. It converts assembly code into 32-bit machine code using a Flask backend and a web frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The backend validates instructions, resolves labels, and ensures correct register usage (R1â€“R16). The frontend provides a user-friendly interface.
