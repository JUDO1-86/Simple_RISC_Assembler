RULES :

1) Don't give (,) while writing code give spaces 
ex: add,r1,r2,r3 is wrong
    add r1 r2 r3 is correct

2) while writing store and load don't write offset as imm[r2] instead write it as r2 imm
ex: ld r1 r2 5  instead ld r1 5[r2]

3) while giving labeling use ( : ) after label to consider it as label
ex: label:

4) don't write code beside label instead write below it.
ex: .label:
        add r1 r2 r3
5) Don't put comments while using cmp instruction on the same line of instruction 
ex: cmp r3, 0 @ compare number with 0 is wrong 
    just write cmp r3, 0
